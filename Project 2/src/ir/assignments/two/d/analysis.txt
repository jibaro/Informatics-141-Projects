One Big loop to go through all the Characters - 			  O(N)
	For loop inside to get occurances - 			      M = O(N)
	For loop to go in the range of Occurances 			  O(M)
		For Loop to check if palindrome exists in list<Frequency> O(P)
		Loop for validity of the palindrome			  O(Q)

N = Length of the whole phrase from text
M = Occurances in the N
P = Depends on how many items are in list<Frequency>
Q = Depends if length of the palindrome found

O(N) * ((N + M) * (P + Q)) ~ O(N^2)
